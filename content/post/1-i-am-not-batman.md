I had this url for two and a half years now. I was going to start a blog and write some stuff. Get some audience. Give back to the community. Become a somebody.

And yet, here I am - third year into owning this domain and only three posts to my name.

I became a bystander while daydreaming about being Batman.

Something needs to change. I'm past the going with your parents to the opera age, and my mom's name is not Martha, and I don't have Batman-level money. So being Batman is out of the question. I guess I'm going to have to do this the hard way.

## The Hard Way

The plan is simple. Practice, practice, practice. Specifically, write 50 posts of at least 250 words a piece, and produce at least one per week. And since I know that I'll cheat, I'll give myself an out. The goal is to produce an *average* of one post per week. This means I can skip a week and catch up later.

I know myself, and I'm designing a system that works for me. Don't judge me.

## What does this have to do with Tech?

Alright, since this is supposed to be a tech blog, lets connect this back to software and stuff.

The world of software is full of Batmanesque figures. Brilliant Developers, excellent Testers, visionary Designers, enchanting Conference Speakers, and plenty of other people all doing excellent work in their respective fields.

They can be intimidating as you're starting out. And if my experience is any indication, they're still intimidating a few years in.

Don't let their superhero status stop you from doing the right thing.

We all can't be Batman.
